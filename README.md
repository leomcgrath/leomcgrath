# 👋 Hi, I'm Leo Lie McGrath

🎓 I'm a Computer Science M.Sc. student at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), currently in my third year, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**.

💻 I’m passionate about building things — from full-stack web apps to social platforms, from playful prototypes to systems that scale. Whether it's frontend with **React/Next.js**, backend with **Supabase/Firebase**, or data pipelines and ML workflows, I love combining engineering and creativity.

🚀 Currently working on:
- A **“friendly betting” app** that brings prediction markets to friend groups (inspired by Polymarket, but with good vibes only)
- Internal projects and events with **BRAIN NTNU** (AI Student Organization) and **Arrkom** (social committee of Abakus)

🌍 I’ve also:
- Led events for hundreds of students, including NTNU's wildest **Beer Mile**
- Built and launched group projects using **Scrum**, test-driven development, and CI/CD in academic and volunteer settings
- Interned at [Equinor]

🛠️ Stack I use and love:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, SQL, Assembly
- **Frameworks/Libs**: React, Next.js, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, JUnit, Mockito, Pandas, SparkSQL
- **Tools**: Supabase, Firebase, Git, Docker, Figma, LaTeX, Cytoscape  
- **Other interests**: Algorithms & Operating Systems, UI/UX

🎺 Fun facts:
- Trumpet player and party planner — I live for the duality of deep focus and chaotic vibes
- Ran a beer mile. Sober-coded a Supabase listener before and after. Still undefeated.
- Currently trying to quit energy drinks. Ask me how it’s going. (It’s not.)
